# Life After Drupal 5 & 6?
## Upgrading or Leaving Drupal

If you have a Drupal 5 website, your site’s software was last up-to-date in 2011. Following the “[End of Life Announcement](http://drupal.org/node/1027214)”, Drupal 5 has no longer been an active, supported platform.

A similar fate is quickly approaching for Drupal 6. According to Dries Buytaert, [Drupal 8 will be released in September, 2013](http://buytaert.net/updated-drupal-8-release-schedule). When this happens, Drupal 6 will also not be supported anymore.

When your website’s Drupal version is no longer supported, there are 3 major problems:

1. **Website security**. With countless Drupal 5 and 6 sites around, online attackers may find it worth their time to hack or exploit them. When a Drupal version is no longer supported, there are no security fixes for new cracks. This leaves your site vulnerable and can contribute to performance problems.

2. **Hosting concerns**. As a web hosting provider, we need to update our servers for efficiency and security. These older Drupal versions are no longer compatible with current PHP hosting software. Therefore, we have to create special server setups to specifically run the older software. With fewer Drupal 5 (and 6) sites being hosted, the expense of keeping infrastructure to support them is shared by fewer users and thus becomes more expensive over time.

3. **Maintenance and improvements**. It is difficult to maintain and provide support for technology that we and other developers don’t work on anymore. Any issues or feature enhancements take extra time to perform, and they do not carry forward (without extra work) once a site is updated beyond Drupal 5 or 6.

So if you have a Drupal 5 or 6 website, you are likely wondering 'what is the best response to this existing or approaching obsolescence?'

In general, there are 2 ways to proceed:

1. Stay within Drupal and upgrade to the latest available version.  If you have a Drupal 5 website, you should take action soon! By moving to Drupal 7 you will make a large jump in software quality and ensure your site is future proof for at least a few more years.  If you have a Drupal 6 site, you’ll most likely want to wait until Drupal 8 arrives to get the latest-and-greatest Drupal along with maximizing your future-proofing investment.

  Be aware that upgrading to the latest Drupal version for all but the most simple Drupal sites is a tricky endeavor, and each site has its own preferred upgrade path to follow. In addition to being time-consuming (read: expensive), another downside is that hosting will continue to require up-to-date software and optimized servers. Also, the latest Drupal version will still need periodic updates to remain secure and stable. And the final downside -- as I’m sure you’re already thinking -- is that in a matter of time this brand shiny new Drupal site will also be unsupported by the community, leaving you to start the upgrade cycle again.

  In spite of all this, there are many people for whom the complexity and cost of staying within Drupal will be worth it. They are accustomed to their CMS, perhaps are using many of Drupal’s powerful features, and have made sufficient investment into their Drupal site thus far to warrant staying there.

2. Leave Drupal and move to another setup that provides the look and features you want without the complexity of Drupal. Like many development shops, we started by building simple (brochure-style) websites using the Drupal platform. As these Drupal 5 became unsupported, we began to realize that many clients would benefit from an alternative to Drupal in terms of upgrade and hosting costs.

  Put simply, the overhead and expensive of staying within Drupal were no longer the best way forward. As such, in 2012 we began developing a new offering that solves this problem very elegantly. The main characteristic is the separation of content from its presentation. The elements of your content (i.e. text/images or interactive features) are managed "in the cloud", while the presentation (i.e. the look or theme) is delivered as clean static pages that require fewer hosting resources (and no security updates to speak of).

  In many cases, the cloud features that we include are better than the corresponding Drupal modules, giving you more features and your visitors a better user experience right away! In addition, we have built a cool new service that allows you to update your content using the free [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/) service that millions of people are already using.

With either approach, Sundays Energy is here to help you make the best choice for the short- and long-term success of your website.
