# Why switch to Create Anywhere Publish Everywhere (CAPE)?

## Performance

Content rarely changes. It is a complete waste of resources to load a database and software to handle the processing it into the final html markup. It's difficult to get higher performance than serving static files. Dynamic content can be handled with various third party javascript libraries. Ever get a notice from your host that your website is using too many resources? CPU or Memory issues will be gone forever when your site is statically cached.

## Data Protection

Own your content. If you use a blogging service like Tumblr you should have a backup of all your posts. Do you? CAPE accepts various sources of information and stores them in plain text files. They are easy to edit anywhere and can be published everywhere.

## Security

Serving static HTML is inherently safe. No server side scripts to get attacked, or abused. Anytime your site is being dynamically generated that software must be updated regularly or you are at risk for security vulnerabilities.

## Focus on the content

Interfaces change, content remains. It's too difficult to have layout specific information in the content if you want to display the content in more than one place. The content needs to be **presentation agnostic**. One of the greatest things about the Web is its universality. Web-enabled devices are everywhere. Your content should be accessible from any device. A Content Management System should focus on **managing content**. 

## Responsive Design

The web is responsive by nature. Responsive design gets really difficult to accomplish when there is display rules mixed in with the content. Often times layout breaks on certain devices or layouts. It's impossible to test for all the possibilities. Design for the flexibility and the unknown.

## Versatility

Desktop applications, web applications, mobile applications. All devices can by sources of content. Why limit yourself to creating content to a single place focused toward a single device.

## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)


## Drupal is Slow and Complicated

You'll only be as good as the mean of those around you. The Drupal community is home to many semi-developer freelancers. Drupal enables a ton of functionality without being a programmer. Need some added functionality? There is a module for that. A module that could have been written for a specific job and the maintainer is no longer getting paid to work on it.
