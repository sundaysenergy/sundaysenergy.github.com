## Domain-based Email Hosting

We used to provide email hosting on our servers, but for the past few years have been moving clients to a domain-based Google Apps setup that includes Gmail.

This includes great spam filtering, a nice online web interface, huge storage capacity (over 10GB), and all the options of Google Apps (such as spreadsheets, document sharing, etc.). It's also extremely reliable, and effectively prevents any email issues. It's a service we couldn't compete with, so we started recommending it and switching clients to it.

Google used to provide this free for up to 10 email accounts. However, as of December 2012 Google Apps has removed this free option.  They now charge either $5/user/month, or $50/user/year (a "user" is the same as the number of distinct email inboxes you need). If you intend on using many of the services included in Google Apps (such as Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides), then this is still a cost-effective and high-quality option.

However, if all you really wish to have is a nice basic e-mail option connected to your domain, Zoho Mail is a more cost-effective option. The 'Lite' option offers up to 3 users for free.  See: http://www.zoho.com/mail/

The one drawback of either approach is the initial setup and configuration. It's possible to do yourself by visiting [Zoho Mail Signup](https://mail.zoho.com/mailsignup.do?plan=free) or [Google Apps Signup](https://www.google.com/a/signup/). Alternatively, we can set it up and configure Zoho Mail for $49 and Google Apps for $99.

## Sundays Energy Domain-based E-mail and Apps Setup Service

1. We create a free Zoho Mail or Google Apps for Business setup for your website.
2. We remake all your current e-mail accounts in the new setup.
3. We send you the new login details, and you're ready to go!

Note: e-mails currently in webmail accounts won't automatically be transferred. If you want or need existing emails transfered, it is $49 per email account. If you're syncing a computer-based program (like Outlook) to your email, you'll still have the old e-mails on your computer.
