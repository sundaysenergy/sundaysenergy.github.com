## Site Import

We can import Drupal 5, 6, or 7 sites. You will need to provide us with as many access credentials as possible including FTP, cPanel, and SSH if possible.

### Import from an archive you provide
$149.00
With this service Sundays Energy will import one site hosted elsewhere to the Sundays Energy Aegir hosting system. It requires an archive of drupal code and files and a database dump file. The archive needs to be uploaded to our servers or it can be accessible via http, ftp, or ssh. Includes 2 months of standard hosting or 1 month of commerce hosting.

### Import raw site via FTP and Drupal

$199.00
We will help you extract the files and database from a site currently hosted on another service provider. In addition to the usernames and passwords requested above we will need a Drupal admin login. Includes 4 months of standard hosting or 2 months of commerce hosting.
